What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Creates a hidden git directory in my repository which will contain git metadata
- This is required in order to start creating git commits for my project and have version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

- Staging area is an intermediary between working directory and repository

What value do you think it offers?

- Allows me to add and remove files before committing them

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- By running git diff with no arguments so I can see the changes I have made between the staging area and the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

- When making experimental features in my project or making a different version of it (such as a Spanish version).
- Branches help as when my experimental feature or my different version is complete I can then merge it back with the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

- They allow me to see visually how a branch structure is laid out and what commits are on which branches.
- They also allow me to see which commit each branch has branched off of the master branch.
