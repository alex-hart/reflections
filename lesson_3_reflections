When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When collaborating with other people on a project
- When I will be working from different workstations, e.g. from home and from an office
- When I want to backup my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because any new changes pulled from GitHub manually may interfere with whatever I am working on from my local repository.
